The goals of the HarmonisedNAP Metadata-ConceptualModel are the following:

- A common metadata approach for accessibility and exchange of NAP datasets.
- Definition and maintenance of a common metadata catalogue for all NAPs in Europe

The documentation of the NAPCORE Metadata (Ontology) is organized as follows:

In [doc](https://github.com/lcomet/testingWidoco/tree/main/napDocumentation/doc) different files are available, such as different serializations of the ontology, i.e., ontology.jsonld, ontology.nt, ontology.rdf, ontology.ttl.

The output of the documentation can be published online.
